# Style-guide

## REMEMBER

Styling should be the last thing you do for your app!!!!! It is the polish at the end that will make your app more appealing to the general public.

## Before we style ...

Before you begin the process of deciding the styles that make up your app's personality, you need to be in touch with what that personality is.  You need to know at minimum your app's purpose and user story. 

Purpose is just answering what is the purpose of your site? 

A user story is a breif script about who would use your app "As a _role_, I want _feature_ so that _reason_." Having a fleshed out idea of who your user is and what they want is the best approach to making major app decisions. Visualizing someone you know very well who would use your app is the easiest option. The idea is that if you design an app for a single user you end up creating features that would appeal to a large group of people.
 
## Look & Feel

Look and feel encompasses personality, mood, and tone. 

Personality tends to be a human-like characteristic such as "friendly" or "professional".

Mood is the overall feeling of the app like "elegant" or "minimalistic".

Tone here is referring to tone of voice which can be captured in slogans and taglines ("Just Do It"). 

Deciding your apps personality, mood, and tone should align with your purpose and user story.  You will choose colors and fonts that align with personality, mood, and tone you are going for.

## Branding

Choosing color and font for your physical logo is a different process than choosing color and font for the rest of your app. This is where you can let your creativity fly but (once again) it should still align with your brands personality. Brand colors are associated with certain emotions as you can see in the guide below.

In terms of typography, this is your opportunity to use Display Faces or Script if you would like. We will go over what that means in the next section.

## Typography 

| Typeface      | Definition     | Where it should be used?  | Mood, Tone, Personality
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Serif      | have feet at edges of letters | blogs, newspapers, ebooks, books, paragraph text | elegant, refined, scholarly |
| Sans Serif    | does not have feet | headlines, captions, paragraph text | clean, easy-to-read, modern, playful |
| Script   | handwriting, has loops and curves | logos, headlines, small details | elegant, feminine, ornate |
| Display faces   | lots of personality | logos, headlines, short emphasized text for flair | could be anything |

The Typography typeface that you choose varies with the html element hierarchy. As you get lower in the hierarchy the more simple and readable your typography should be. So logos can be full of personality, but the paragraph text should be simple and clean. 

One of the most difficult parts of typography can be choosing a good font pairing or the typography that is associated with each type of element. For help with this you can go to [fontpair.co](https://fontpair.co/).

## Color

Web Design color schemes are vastly different than choosing color schemes in other design fields. A good starter rule of thumb is to start with a scheme of 5 colors. 

The first 2 colors should be your base color and they should be contrasting. Typically these are white and light grey, white and blue, white and dark grey, but you can get more daring if you are color savvy. 

Next you can choose 1 neutral tone between those two colors to provide a slight variety. 

Last you can choose 2 pop colors. These are for drawing user attention to specific parts of the page. They are designed to navigate your user through the site so use them strategically. For pop colors I recommend using [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=2&rule=Complementary&selected=0&name=My%20Color%20Theme&mode=rgb&rgbvalues=0.7,0.4776229026641497,0.16164028344175027,1,0.6282422673045402,0.09999999999999998,1,0.5869358525606003,0,0,0.4232414315308233,0.7,0,0.6046306164726047,1&swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4) and using their color relationships (analogous, monochromatic, triad, complementary, compound, and shades) to choose colors that work well together.

Here the first and last colors are pop colors. The second and fourth are contrasting base colors. The third is neutral.

Once again, choose colors that align with your apps Look & Feel!!


## Universal Web Design Rules

* paragraph text should be no smaller than 16px for readability
* Never use pure black or pure white.  It hurts users eyes making your app difficult to view.

## All done and want to know if you app UX/UI makes sense? Ask yourself these questions...

* As a user, how easy is it to navigate through your site?
* Does the site feel cluttered or complicated?
* Do the elements of the page compete or compliment each other?
* Is the content prioritized so that as a new or existing user I know where to go first?
* Are forms easy to use? Does it allow me to submit bad data? Does it tell me what I did wrong?
* Are search results easy to view? Are they time consuming to sort through?
